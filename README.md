This repository is my implementation of the Lox language in the book *Craft Interpreters*, the offical repo is in [here](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters).

# Progress of Chapter 2

* [x] Scanning *2023/5/30*
* [x] Representing Code *2023/6/10*
* [ ] Parsing Expressions
* [ ] Evalute Expressions
* [ ] Statements and State
* [ ] Control Flow
* [ ] Functions
* [ ] Resolving and Binding
* [ ] Classes
* [ ] Inheritance

**Notice**: In my Python code, I mix camel case naming and underscore naming conventions. This is a habit I carried over from writing Swift, but you should not use this approach. You should instead use the recommended underscore naming convention in Python.

Thanks for [this project](https://github.com/MtScience/PyLox) when I had trouble implementing Lox in Python.
